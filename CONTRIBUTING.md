# How to contribute

Thank you for looking at this. We, at Kubeshop, are really excited to have you contribute on the project with us.

The project is still new, so the main lines of communication with our team is through github issues or direct messages (more to be announced).

## Testing

We have a great ambition to have tests verify every important corner of our code-base. It will be greatly appreciated, if your pr's include tests for the changes you propose.

## Submitting changes

Please send a Github Pull-Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love if you include examples. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We use code formatting tools to help maintain peace in the galaxy.

Many thanks,
Kubeshop
